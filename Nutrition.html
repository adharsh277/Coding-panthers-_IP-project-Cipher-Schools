    <h1>Foods To Add To Your Gym Diet Plan</h1>
    <p>There are mainly three macronutrients that play a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions and even promote changes in strength and composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats and it is essential that we consume all three macros in ample quantities to optimize progress accordingly. Let’s see what are the vital nutrients you must include in your gym diet plan for muscle gain and weight loss.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Carbohydrates</h1>

    <p>Firstly, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates i.e. complex and simple. The names give an indication of the time taken to digest complex carbs that take a longer time period to digest than simple carbs.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, complex carbohydrates provide the body with prolonged slow-release of energy and have a great nutritional benefit. While simple carbohydrates provide the body with a short-term, fast releasing energy, they contain little nutritional value.

    </p>
    <p>Therefore, you should consume complex carbohydrates for example whole-grains, beans, nuts, fruits, and vegetables for maintaining a proper gym diet plan.</p>
    <h1>Protein</h1>

    <p>Specifically, the majority of gym-goers will be well aware that consuming protein is important. Likewise, the reason why protein is so important is because it plays a key role in recovery and repair. A gym diet plan must include protein. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses. This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.</p>
    <p>Protein is found most highly in animal produce such as lean meats, eggs & dairy. Similarly, it can also be found in smaller quantities in foods such as seeds, nuts, legumes, beans, and soy.</p>
